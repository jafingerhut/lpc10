dam9.spd is a sample input file for the LPC-10 speech coder.
dam9-out.spd is the result after being compressed and then
decompressed on a Sun Sparc machine.  I've gotten results that sound
the same to me, although many samples had different values, from an
Intel 486 machine running Linux.

Note that both of these files contain 16 bit samples, and each 16 bit
sample has the most significant byte first, i.e., big-endian order.
This works fine for big-endian machines, like Sun Sparcs.

For Intel machines, the nuke and unnuke programs that are part of this
distribution expect little-endian order, i.e., the least significant
byte of each sample should come first.  These files can be converted
to such a format with the GNU "dd" program, as shown below.  Non-GNU
versions of "dd" might work as well.

dd conv=swab < dam9.spd > dam9-littlendian.spd

dam9.bits is the the output of the nuke program that I get when running
the following command line:

nuke < dam9.spf > dam9.bits

dam9-out.spd is the of unnuke for the command line:

unnuke < dam9.bits > dam9-out.spd



The .spd files here can be converted using the 'sox' application into
other audio formats.  For example, on a big-endian machine like a
PowerPC Mac, you can use this:

# -t raw: raw input file format
# -r 8000: sample rate is 8000 Hertz
# -s: sample format is signed linear
# -w: sample data size is 16-bit words
# -c 1: 1 sound channel, i.e. mono

sox -t raw -r 8000 -s -w -c 1 dam9.spd dam9.aiff
sox -t raw -r 8000 -s -w -c 1 dam9-out.spd dam9-out.aiff


sox josh-the-psalm-of-life.wav -t raw -r 8000 -s -w -c 1 josh-the-psalm-of-life.spd
nuke < josh-the-psalm-of-life.spd > josh-the-psalm-of-life.bits
unnuke < josh-the-psalm-of-life.bits > josh-the-psalm-of-life-out.spd
sox -t raw -r 8000 -s -w -c 1 josh-the-psalm-of-life-out.spd josh-the-psalm-of-life-out.aiff


sox owen-the-germ.wav -t raw -r 8000 -s -w -c 1 owen-the-germ.spd
nuke < owen-the-germ.spd > owen-the-germ.bits
unnuke < owen-the-germ.bits > owen-the-germ-out.spd
sox -t raw -r 8000 -s -w -c 1 owen-the-germ-out.spd owen-the-germ-out.aiff
