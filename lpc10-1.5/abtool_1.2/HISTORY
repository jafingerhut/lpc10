           A/B Tool  Revision history

Still To Do:
  Plot window.
  Should use XView 3.2 file chooser instead of gfm.
  Load/Save Segment boundaries.
  Implement play command and other audio devices.

Version 1.2  September 1993  dpk

  Open files specified on command line after tool window is mapped
  Set frame busy while opening files and computing energy
  Add property option to hold audio device open or release it when idle
    (when released, it allows other audio applications to run, but a
     driver bug causes a loud click every time the audio device is opened)
  Add property option to select other devices (play command, MTU or
     DAT-Link), but no code to support them.
  Align properties sheet below main window.
  Add icon image.

 Version 1.1  August 1993  dpk

  Converted to Solaris 2, added some function prototypes.
  Added "Audio..." button to spawn audiocontrol (or any other command,
   as specified in properties sheet).
  Added "Quit" button.
  Changed "Play" button to "Stop" while files are playing.  This
   immediately flushes the audio device and empties the request queue.
  Fixed bug in play code that could write an odd number of bytes.
   This hangs the DBRI driver in Solaris 2.2 when in 16 bit linear mode.
  General rewrite of play event handler for robustness.

Version 1.0  January 1993  dpk

  Initial release for SunOS 4.1.2
  Energy plot window not implemented.
