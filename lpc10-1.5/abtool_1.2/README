  A/B Tool is a program for playing A/B comparisons between speech files.
It generates the necessary segment boundaries on the fly, eliminating
the need to create play scripts by hand.  A/B Tool scans files for gaps
between segments of speech and compensates for delay between files.
It can automatically play corresponding segments from multiple files
in user-specified order, or it can play a single segment from one file
at a time to allow critical comparisons.

Usage:

  The simplest usage of abtool is to start it with the desired
files listed on the command line:

   abtool *.spd
or
   abtool file_a file_b file_c ...

and then press the "Play A/B" button.  This will scan the first file
for segment boundaries, align the remaining files to the first, and
play corresponding segments from each file in the order listed.

Controls:

  File / "Load SPD" - Pops up the file navigator, allowing the user to
    open additional speech files.

  File / "Load Seg"
  File / "Save Seg" - Allows the user to load and save custom segment
    boundaries.  **Not Yet Implemented**

  "Audio..." - this starts up the Sun deskset application "audiocontrol",
    for setting the volume, headphone/speaker port, etc.  An alternate
    command can be specified in the properties sheet.

  Drop Box - currently inoperative, but future versions may allow
    drag 'n drop for opening files.

  "Quit" - terminates abtool and any spawned application.

  "Play A/B" - Plays an A/B comparison, as specified by the AB: and
    Seg: fields.
  "Stop" - while playing, the "Play A/B" button changes to "Stop",
    which has the expected functionality.

  "AB:" - Specifies the order in which segments are played.  There
    can be up to 26 files open simultaneously, each identified by
    a single letter.  For example, if 3 files are open, specifying
    "abc" here would play them in order; "aba" would play a segment
    from the first file, followed by the second, followed by a 
    repeat of the first.  "cc" would play each segment from the
    third file twice.  Letter identifiers are case-insensitive.

  "Seg:" - Specifies the segment (or sentence) number to play.
    If this field is 0, comparisons are played for all segments
    in sequential order.  If this field is a valid segment number,
    a single comparison for that segment is played.

  "Segs:" - Displays the number of segments currently defined.  The
    first file specified on the command line is automatically scanned
    for segments, and segments can be recomputed with the "Segment"
    command described below.

  File List - The top part of the tool contains a list of open files,
    identified by letter.  The user can select a file from this list
    and bring up a menu with the following options:

      "Play" - play the entire file.
      "Close" - close the file.
      "Graph" - display the file's energy in the plot window.
      "Segment" - scan the file to define a new segment list.

  Plot window - The bottom part of the tool contains a graph of
    energy tracks, segmentation parameters, and segment boundaries.
    **Not Yet Implemented**

    To play an individual segment from one file, enter the segment
    number in the "Seg:" field (above), then place the keyboard
    focus in the plot window by clicking the mouse.  The specified
    segment from particular files can be played by typing the file's
    identifier letter.  This allows the user to repeat the segment
    as many times as desired, for critical comparisons.

    At any time, playing can be interrupted by pressing the "Stop"
    button.  Typing a space (or other invalid character) in the plot
    window will stop queueing any new data but allow the audio device
    to finish playing whatever is already in the pipeline.

  "Properties..." - Brings up a window containing additional controls
    and information, as listed below:

      "Graph" - selects RMS or Peak energy in the plot window.
      "Time" - selects the time scale for energy plots.
      "Auto Scale" - enables gain normalization during play.
      "Gain" - allows modification of a file's play gain.
      "Filenames" - hides filenames to allow blind comparisons.

      "Ref:" - shows which file is the reference, i.e. the one which
        was most recently segmented.  To segment a file, select it
        in the File List (above), and choose Segment from the menu.
      "File:" - shows which file is selected in the File List.

      "Delay" - time delay between the reference and selected files.
        The Segment command segments the reference file and then aligns
        all other open files to it.  To show the alignment for a
        particular file, select it from the File List.
      "Max Delay" - maximum time delay (in both directions) over
        which to search for the best alignment.
      "Corr" - the best correlation found between the reference and
        selected files.  If this is less than .9, the files may not
        contain the same speech material, making A/B comparisons less
        useful.

      "Thresh:", "Gap:", and "Pad:" - segmentation parameters.
        Segments are defined as an interval of signal with energy
        (in dB) above the "Threshold", surrounded by intervals below
        "Threshold" with a minimum duration specified by "Gap".  Segment
        boundaries are placed "Pad"/2 ms. before and after the high-
        energy interval.  To segment a file, set the desired parameters
        here, select a file from the file list, select "Segment" from
        the file list menu, and observe the "Segs" display to determine
        how many segments were found.

Audio Devices:

  Abtool currently works with Sun audio devices: the 8 kHz 8 bit AMD
device used in the Sparcstation 1/2/IPX, and the 16 bit programmable
sample rate DBRI device used in the Sparcstation 10/LX.  Abtool will
convert between encoding formats (linear and mu-law) on the fly, but
it will not do sample rate conversion.  If a file does not have a valid
Sun audiofile header, it is assumed to be 16 bit linear, 8 kHz, mono.
Files of different encodings may be open simultaneously and will be
properly translated.  Other devices may be specified in the "Audio I/O"
choice, but this is currently ignored.

  The "Hold/Release" switch determines whether the audio device is
held open or closed when not in use.  If the device is held open, other
audio applications (play, xbiff, etc) will not be able to access it.
This may be desirable for critical listening or generating a recording.

  Abtool does not do device control; use gaintool, audiotool, or
audiocontrol to set the volume and select the desired output port(s).
The "Audio..." button will spawn a copy of "audiocontrol"; an alternate
command can be specified in the Properties sheet if desired.

Possible enhancements:

 * Support for additional audio devices (MTU, DAT-Link).
 * File output, for generating comparison tapes.
 * Adding silence between segments.
 * Additional audio file encodings (float, 24/32/48 kbps ADPCM)

Standard disclaimer:

  Version 1.2 should still be considered beta software.  As far as I
know it works correctly, but there is still a fair amount of work to
do - most notably in the plot window.
