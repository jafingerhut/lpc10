@Just added a few comments about which array indices of the arguments
are used, and mentioning that this subroutine has no local state.

*****************************************************************
*
*  Invert a covariance matrix using Choleski decomposition method.
*
* Input:
*  ORDER            - Analysis order
*  PHI(ORDER,ORDER) - Covariance matrix
*                     Indices (I,J) read, where ORDER .GE. I .GE. J .GE. 1.
*                     All other indices untouched.
*  PSI(ORDER)       - Column vector to be predicted
*                     Indices 1 through ORDER read.
* Output:
*  RC(ORDER)        - Pseudo reflection coefficients
*                     Indices 1 through ORDER written, and then possibly read.
* Internal:
*  V(ORDER,ORDER)   - Temporary matrix
*                     Same indices written as read from PHI.
*                     Many indices may be read and written again after
*                     initially being copied from PHI, but all indices
*                     are written before being read.
*
*  NOTE: Temporary matrix V is not needed and may be replaced
*    by PHI if the original PHI values do not need to be preserved.

*       Arguments

	INTEGER ORDER
	REAL PHI(ORDER,ORDER), PSI(ORDER), RC(ORDER)

*	Parameters/constants

	REAL EPS
	PARAMETER (EPS=1.0E-10)

*       Local variables that need not be saved

	INTEGER I, J, K
	REAL V(MAXORD,MAXORD), SAVE

*  Decompose PHI into V * D * V' where V is a triangular matrix whose
*   main diagonal elements are all 1, V' is the transpose of V, and
*   D is a vector.  Here D(n) is stored in location V(n,n).

	         V(I,J) = V(I,J) - V(I,K)*SAVE
	      END DO

*  Compute intermediate results, which are similar to RC's

	END DO
	RETURN

*  Zero out higher order RC's if algorithm terminated early

100	DO I = J,ORDER
	   RC(I) = 0.
	END DO

*  Back substitute for PC's (if needed)

*110	DO J = ORDER,1,-1
