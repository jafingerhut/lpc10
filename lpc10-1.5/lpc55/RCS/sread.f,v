@Commented out access to ICLIP, which is just a debugging variable that
was defined in the COMMON block CONTRL in contrl.fh.  Also commented
out the inclusion of control.fh, which is no longer necessary.

* 
* 'len' must be at most RECLEN=1024, otherwise these functions abort the
* program.
* 
* 
* function sread
* 
* Read in at most 'len' 16 bit audio samples from the input file
* descriptor 'fd', and convert them from 16 bit two's complement form to
* real numbers in the range -1 to +1.  The converted real samples are
* stored in the array 'buf'.  The number of such samples read is
* returned.
* 
* Input:
*  fd   - File descriptor for input file to read from.
*  len  - Maximum number of samples to read.
* Output:
*  buf  - Audio samples that were read.
*         Indices 1 through n (the function return value) written.
* Return value:
*  n    - The number of samples actually read, between 0 and len, inclusive.
* 
* 
* 
* function swrite
* 
* swrite writes out 'len' 16 bit audio samples from the array 'buf' to
* the file descriptor 'fd', converting the real values in the range -1
* to +1, to integers in the range -32768 to +32767, clipping any values
* out of range to the appropriate extreme value (the statistics counter
* iclip is incremented for every sample where this happens).  The scaled
* values are rounded/truncated in whatever way Fortran does for
* assignments of reals to integers.
* 
* Input:
*  fd   - File descriptor for input file to write to.
*  buf  - Audio samples to write.
*         Indices 1 through len read.
*  len  - Number of samples to write.
* Return value:
*  n    - The number of samples actually written.
*         If n samples are successfully written, the value returned is
*         n.  If not successful, the program is aborted.
