* Comment block describing which arguments are inputs, and which
* are outputs.

* Input:
*  A - 
* Input/Output:
*  B - 
* Output:
*  C - 

* One of the following comment blocks:

*
* This subroutine has no local state.
*

* 
* This subroutine maintains local state from one call to the next.  If
* you want to switch to using a new audio stream for this filter, or
* reinitialize its state for any other reason, call the ENTRY
* INIT*
*


	SUBROUTINE/FUNCTION declaration

*       INCLUDE statements for header files, if any.

*       Arguments

*       Function return value definitions

*       Parameters/constants

*       Local variables that need not be saved

*       Local state

*	This section contains local variables whose values should be
*	saved from one call to the next.  They should all have SAVE
*	statments.  They should all have initial values specified with
*	DATA statements, or a comment explaining why the variable will
*	be initialized before it is used.  It should be possible to
*	restore these initial values with a call to an entry whose
*	name is the same as the subroutine's, with "INIT" prepended to
*	it.
