*       Currently the size of the frames, LFRAME, is set to MAXFRM,
*       which is set to 180.  I wonder what the restrictions might be on
*       other values that this code will work for?

*       Preprocessing (PREPRO) consists of passing the frame through a
*       100 Hz high-pass filter, implemented in the subroutine HP100().
*       I don't know what order filter it is, but the current
*       implementation requires 7 real multiplications and 8 real
*       additions/subtractions per sample.  I don't know enough about
*       writing filters to know if that can be reduced, but Bill would
*       know.  Perhaps the filter could even be removed or modified.
