log
@I tried removing the "#ifdef sun" wrapper around the definitions of
the functions etime_ and time_, because I thought it might fix a
problem on Solaris where lpcsim was printing values on the order of
1000's of seconds of elapsed time, when I expected something about
1/1000'th of the value printed.  I might work more on fixing this
later.

 * I believe that this file was written by Bill Dorsey, because these
 * functions were called from the LPC-10 code, but were not present in
 * the libraries available to him.  They weren't available to me
 * either, when I tried to compile this code on my Linux machine using
 * f2c and gcc, so I'm copying it.

 * $Log: extra.c,v $
 * Revision 1.4  1996/02/13  00:06:23  jaf
 * I removed the conditional inclusion of <sys/rusage.h>.  On the Solaris
 * 5.3 machine I have access to, this include file is only available in
 * the BSD compatibility include files /usr/ucbinclude and the BSD
 * compatibility libraries /usr/ucblib/libucb.a.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1996/02/12  03:18:57  jaf
 * Added the definition of function time_(), which is just a call to the
 * GNU C library time() function, at least on my Linux machine.  More
 * #ifdef'ing will likely be needed to make this file more portable.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1996/02/12 03:04:30  jaf
 * I just added a conditional inclusion of the file <sys/rusage.h>, when
 * compiling on a Sun machine.  I did this some time ago, and have
 * forgotten the exact problems that I had when trying to compile without
 * it.  I do know that I was trying to compile it on a Solaris 5.3
 * machine.  It might be better if the #ifdef was more particular to this
 * operating system, instead of all Sun machines.
 *
 * I also commented out the definition for lnblnk_, because I have
 * already written a Fortran definition for this function in lnblnk.c.
