Except for this README-1.5 file, this directory and all its
subdirectories contain the expanded version of a file lpc10-1.5.tar.gz
that I published on an old personal web page of mine, which was no
longer published starting some time around 2008 or so.

It contains all enhancements that I personally ever made to the
original LPC-10 Fortran code, and my translation of it to C code.
