# Pattern rules for using f2c and cc as a Fortran compiler, with
# optional patch files for the automatically converted C programs.
# 
######################################################################

# I could just use the fort77 script to automatically run f2c for me,
# and then run the C compiler on the result, but I would like to be
# able to convert files from .f to .c with f2c, and then possibly make
# hand modifications to the .c files.  The following cancelling of the
# built-in Fortran compilation rules, and replacing it with the rules
# for converting Fortran to C, should let me do that.

# Of course, this leaves open the possibility that I make hand
# modifications to a C file, and then make modifications to the
# Fortran file from which it was created.  The next run of make would
# overwrite any hand modifications made to the C file.  To overcome
# this, I might want to consider making hand modifications to C files
# and save them as "patches" to the automatically created C file, so
# that future conversions of the Fortran to C might automatically have
# the patch applied to them, assuming that the resulting converted C
# file is reasonably close to the one that was patched originally.

# To implement the latter more sophisticated method, I'll probably
# want to define a new suffix for the patch files (".cpatch",
# perhaps?), and write rules for creating .c files from raw f2c output
# and a patch file.  If no patch file exists, the .c file should be
# the same as the raw f2c output.  I'll probably want to define a new
# suffix for the unmodified f2c output file as well (perhaps ".f2c").

# Cancel the built-in rule for compiling Fortran files

%.o : %.f

# The rule for creating .f2c files from .f files.  It uses file
# redirection, because f2c would otherwise create a .c file.

F2C=f2c
F2CFLAGS=

%.f2c : %.f
	$(F2C) $(F2CFLAGS) $(F2CFLAGS_CMDLINE) < $< > $@

# The rule for creating a .c file from a .f2c file, and possibly a
# .f2cpatch file.  If no .f2cpatch file exists, just copy the .f2c
# file to the .c file.

# I don't know yet if the following rule will work as I want it to,
# which is to run the %.f2cpatch file through the patch program.  I'll
# test it.

# In my testing, I found out that one way that seems to work is this.

# Create the .c file output of f2c, say foo.c.  Copy it to a new file
# named something like foo-hand-modified.c.  Make modifications to
# that new file.  Then create the patch file with a command like "diff
# -c foo.c foo-hand-modified.c > foo.f2cpatch".  Then rename the
# foo-hand-modified.c file to something else, e.g.,
# "foo-hand-modified.c.bak", because otherwise when the program patch
# is run, it will see both the foo.c and foo-hand-modified.c file
# names at the beginning of the diff output, and complain that it
# thinks it detected a patch that you are attempting to apply in
# reverse.  This might be because at that time, foo.c is more recent
# than foo-hand-modified.c.

PATCH=patch

%.c : %.f2cpatch %.f2c
	$(COPY) $(basename $@).f2c $@
	$(PATCH) < $<

# The following rule will prevent the intermediate .c file from being
# deleted after they are compiled.  They should still be overwritten
# if the .f file is updated and make is run again.

# I'm going to comment it out for now, since I'm not currently using
# the feature to patch .f2c files produced by f2c.

# I'm putting it back in, because it is useful when using gdb with
# source level tracing of the file.  Without this special rule, there
# are no .c source files to see while tracing.

.PRECIOUS : %.c

# If there is no .f2cpatch file, then hopefully the following rule
# will match instead.  Of course, it might not work that way, but I
# guess we'll see.

COPY=cp

%.c : %.f2c
	$(COPY) $< $@
